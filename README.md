# _Old_scripts
These are a collection of old scripts that I developed or helped develop for past jobs and projects. Most are for geospatial processing, QA/QC, or other basic OS functions to automate repetitive processes.

Please do not use them in any way. They are not meant for use, and no one is granted any permission to use, fork, alter, or reproduce them in any way. They are just for posterity sake and remembrance, really.

Almost all scripts were created between Fall of 2018 to Fall of 2020 across multiple projects and jobs.
